This README will provide you with a step-by-step on how to replicate the pipeline along with the pipeline unit tests.

Step 1) Download the pipeline.py, test_pipeline.py and all the excel files attached.
Step 2) Create a folder called 'Tests'.
Step 3) Withing the 'Tests' folder store the pipeline.py with all the excel files. 
Step 4) Within the 'Tests' folder create a new folder called 'pipeline_test' and store the test_pipeline.py there.
Step 5) Open VS code and click 'Add folder to workspace', in which you will select the 'Tests' folder.
Step 6) Now you should have all the excel files and python files there.
Step 7) Now you can just simply execute 'Pytest' in the terminal to run the unit tests.
